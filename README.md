# FastAGI Tools

Welcome to the FastAGI Tools Repository. You can contribute to this repository by adding your own custom toolkits to [FastAGI's Marketplace](https://marketplace.fastagi.khulnasot.com/) which the community can use to run your toolkits with the agents. 

Here are the instructions to quickly get you started with contributing to FastAGI's Tools Repository: 

1. Start building your toolkit by following the instructions in this [link](https://fastagi.khulnasot.com/docs/Toolkit/custom_toolkit)
2. Once you've built the toolkit, make sure you've taken care of the following before submitting your toolkit for a pull request:
   - All the toolkit documents are made with a snake case.
   - Your Toolkit covers all the required unit tests.
   - You have included a README.md which helps the user configure the toolkit with FastAGI. You can refer to an example Toolkit README [here](https://github.com/khulnasoft/FastAGI-Tools/blob/main/google_analytics/README.md).
3. Start raising a pull request to merge your branch with the main of FastAGI-Tools. Once approved, your tool will be merged to the main and available for the community to use!
